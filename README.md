# DSS-X-Change.org

Hi there! This project was a collaborative effort between 7 UC Berkeley students (Nikki Trueblood, Natraj Vairavan, Kristen Vitolo, Preetha Kumar, Vikash Giritharan, Sooyeon Kim, and Pujitha Nachuri) and Change.org.

Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement, the coding files cannot not be uploaded. Instead, a slide presentation of our final deliverable can be accessed for an in-depth overview of our project, findings, and analyses.

Context: Change.org is a website providing a platform to create petitions for various social causes. 

Key Project Objectives: 
1. Explore factors associated with fast signature growth in petitions.
2. Develop a metric for a "quality petition" in order to measure petition success.
3. Develop a model predicting petition success.
4. Explore factors associated with harmful or abusive content in petitions.
